Mac cons:

  - easy way to install system-wide equalizer (had to buy boom)
  - can't assign window class easily to allow having multiple instances of the same program being 
    managed separately by the WM; alternatively: no wmctrl support
  - can't maximize a window
  - every app showing in dock (or alt-tab) (eg. TimeOut and Headless Eclipse), not easy to hide
  - no easy way of select-copy highlighted text (haven't found a clipboard manager that can do 
    this). In ubuntu parcellite is a very nice one. Main need: copy highlighted text
  - can't use two modifier keys as shortcut (eg. cmd+shift to change key layout)

Ubuntu is missing:

  - super excellent HW drivers (external monitor support is amazing)
  - unified short-cut management
  - easy key remapping (keyremap4macbook)
