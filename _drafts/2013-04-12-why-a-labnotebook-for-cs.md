Main:

  * jekyll (easy to setup; I'll describe in other post my setup)
  * the guy with the biology open notebook
  * writing makes you think differently (drawing too, so including diagrams helps a lot too; but the 
    time-vs-learning trade-off increases significantly)

    tip 31 of 'pragmatic learning':

    > Write on: documenting is more important than documentation (p. 190)

    I haven't used mind maps (I hate the mouse), so I haven't experienced the value of them yet. I 
    think the mix of blogs/diagrams kind of serves the same purpose (the outline is the map)

  * teaching is the best way of learning: others think in different ways and teach you how to be 
    aware of this.

  * we write papers, so writing on the notebook keeps your writing skill sharp

## Openness

Unfortunately, many ... There is risk in exposing ... others get the idea of what you're working, 
etc. etc. Funding..
