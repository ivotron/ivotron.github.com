# ubuntu

PDF forms:
  - xournal

PDF papers:
  - okular (remembering to save as PDF)

epub:
  - okular (doesn't inter-operate with anything)
  - ADE

# Android:

forms/papers:
  - Repligo

epub:
  - Mantano (inter-operates with ADE)

----------------

Ideal solution:

> - Have Mantano (optionally) store annotations in PDF
> - Okular read ADE

With the above, the ebook workflow:

  - Read ebooks in Mantano
  - Synch with ADE
  - Open book in Okular and see notes from Mantano

Alternative: run Okular in android.
Alternative: have annotations in Calibre (for both PDFs and ePubs)
