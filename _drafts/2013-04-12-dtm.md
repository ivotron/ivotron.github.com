> **tl;dr:** I speculate on how a distributed transactional memory framework could be coupled with a 
transactional distributed file system.

high-level idea:

  1. DTM can create checkpoints.
  2. the transaction space can be flattened.
  3. This flatenned checkpoint is pushed down to the filesystem


nice way of explaining:

  - STM is Mx1
  - DS  is 1xN

  - DTM is MxN
