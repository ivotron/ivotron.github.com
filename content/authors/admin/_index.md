Research Scientist at [UC Santa Cruz](https://ucsc.edu), Incubator Fellow at the [UC Santa Cruz Center for Research on Open Source Software (CROSS)](https://cross.ucsc.edu); Adjunct Professor at [University of Sonora](https://unison.mx). Interested in large-scale distributed data management systems, applied aspects of data science, and reproducibility. My [2019 PhD dissertation](https://escholarship.org/content/qt8206n6nz/qt8206n6nz_noSplash_aa992709bea701c3a9d687cb2d229e50.pdf) focused on the practical aspects in the reproducible evaluation of systems research, work for which I was awarded the [2018 Better Scientific Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/items/bssw-fellows-2018-projects-and-perspectives/). I am currently working on [Popper](https://github.com/getpopper/popper), as part of the CROSS Incubator Program.
