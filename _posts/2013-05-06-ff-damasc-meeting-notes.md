We didn't discuss much, just ideas for one-paragraph proposals for ISSDM:

  - transaction coordination
  - sdns
  - perf. models for disk (Adam)
  - DAMASC-related like SIDR or Sci-Hadoop follow-ups
  - noah:
      - problems that can be experimented with at single-node scale
      - how does the content of an object gets re-organized at IOD so that when a read comes they're 
        faster
      - it would help if we can get traces from applications
