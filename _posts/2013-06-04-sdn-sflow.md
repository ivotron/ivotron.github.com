I read a little bit more about sFlow. Executive summary follows:

It's a protocol that was defined in 2001 [@phaal_inmon_2001] by [InMon][inmon]. In 2004 got 
[standardized][std]. Practically all vendors implement it in their switches (including OpenVSwitch). 
It allows to monitor ALL of the network, including host-side applications (assuming a daemon runs 
locally on each host). So this is truly the global view of the datacenter, with very little 
overhead. There's a [13 minute video][vid] that summarizes well their approach.

Since this is only monitoring, it complements very nicely SDN-based applications, such as ours. They 
posted [a series][b1] of [entries][b2] in [their blog][b3] recently, describing how both complement 
each other. The last one exemplifies how to make use of both Floodlight's and sFlow's REST services 
to implement DDoS mitigation.

So in summary, this is kind of in-line to what I had in mind and described this morning about having 
an OF/sFlow-agnostic layer that abstracts this. Since our literature review wasn't extensive enough 
to cover all the work related to software-based QoS, I don't know if there is existing work using 
sflow as part of their solution and whether sflow would be enough to argue in favor of SDN (i.e. 
scalability/accuracy isn't an issue). My plan is to find out more about this in the next couple of 
days.
