So the quarter is over and from the many things I learned (besides the academic topics) is the 
following about plastic bottles. In short, the plastc [IDs][w] to avoid are: 1, 3, 6 and 7. As 
mentioned [here][b] the other numbers aren't guaranteed to be safe, it's just that they haven't been 
studied more. To be safe, I'm avoiding any kind of plastic from now on, specially for my
[portable H2O source][h].

I've been carrying a water bottle for almost 10 years now, so I wonder if I've had any kind of 
damage yet. I hope not..

Now the (not so) long story.

I attended a workshop offered by the fine people at the [Graduate Student Commons][g], it was 
imparted by Jocelyn Dubin from the [Nourish][n] wellness center and among the many things she 
mentioned about how to eat healthy, she cited a research study and told us the plastic IDs we should 
avoid. I'm thankful to the Grad Commons people for organizing these events, they really help us to 
live better :)
