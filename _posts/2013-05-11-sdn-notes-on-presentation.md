 1. OF intro:  1-15
 2. Use cases:
      - Routing: distributed vs. centralized
      - Load balancing as network primitive (is just smart routing)
      - network slicing (isolation)
      - fabric switching (move flows from ethernet to fibber)
      - access control

 3. PANE (all or up to 101)
 4. HFT:
      - hierarchical flow tables (31-55)
      - experiments (paper)
 5. QoS controller
      - slides (11-36)
      - experiment one from paper
 6. Our roadmap:
      - could be similar to QoS controller's
      - integrate rad-flows
 7. Optional (declarative networking)
