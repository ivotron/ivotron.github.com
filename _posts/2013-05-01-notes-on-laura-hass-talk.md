# about the people

in order to be able to navigate the Big Data world successfully you need the right people:

  - data: acquire, integrate, enhance
  - domain: create models, hypothesis
  - informatics (algorithms)
  - math: analyze results
  - systems: handle scale
  - visualization: share results

Big data is multidisciplinary in nature, in order to do it right you have to have the right 
organizational structure
