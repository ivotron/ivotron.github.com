# {{ page.title }}

  - discussed briefly about the work from Brown on [Participatory 
    Networks](http://pane.cs.brown.edu/)
  - Jiabin from Cisco should get in touch with us soon
  - I've been figuring out how to write/read the link capacities of a switch

# Next steps

  - Finish figuring out how to write/read link capacities
  - Figure a route's capacity from the lowest-capable link. This might be specified in Lincoln's 
    paper [@smith_practical_2013].
  - Read [@ferguson_hierarchical_2012]
  - Also read [@ferguson_participatory_2012]
  - Go through [PANE](https://github.com/brownsys/pane) to see if we can get info on how they ensure 
    guarantees on bandwidth.
