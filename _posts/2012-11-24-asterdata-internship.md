# {{ page.title }}

I've been wanting to write about my past summer experience at [Teradata Aster][aster] for a long 
time (I can't believe it's been 3 months already!). I couldn't do it before since I went back to 
school right after finishing my internship, but I took the opportunity this past Thanksgiving 
long-weekend to do so.

# The Project

During my summer at Aster I worked with the Engineering Team, implementing new features in their 
[Aster Analytics Platform][ncluster], an innovative [MPP DBMS][mpp] that it's at the cutting edge of 
technology in today's data-driven world.

We began by scoping a self-contained project that would be (1) small enough that it can be delivered 
in 3 months, (2) large enough so that it has impact on the product in the short-term; (3) and that 
at the same time is more R&D-ish that what the engineering team usually work on (which is not far 
from what they do, since in a company like Aster, R&D-ish is part of the day-to-day business).

It was (and has been) and amazing experience, from beginning to end. I have learned a lot about how 
distributed systems work, the huge difference between academic-like prototypes vs. real enterprise 
software, as well as how to collaborate in a mid-size, fast-passed software engineering team.

At the end of the summer I was able to have an end-to-end demo of the pieces I worked on. I 
presented it to other teams, with very good feedback from them.

# The People / Work Environment

The environment is very startup-like, fast-passed and full of smart people. It is a challenging, but 
at the same time nurturing scenario; a place where your critical thinking is being put to the test 
constantly, which in turn keeps your analytical skills sharp as a knife (and thus you never get 
bored! :)

But work is not all! The social environment is great, we had barbecues every other Friday during the 
summer, went to the San Francisco Academy of Sciences during a weekend and participated in a charity 
event. They also have "games room" on-site, with a football and ping-pong table, ideal for taking 
breaks and relax a bit.

I'm very grateful to all the people I've met and all the things I've learned from them, specially my 
mentors and manager.

# The Aftermath

Currently I keep working as a part-time intern. We are extending the work I began during the summer 
and plan to submit an article to an academic conference or journal.

If your research is on BigData/Analytics/Distributed-Systems/Databases and would like to experience 
how it is to put your knowledge into practice, I highly encourage you to apply for next year's 
summer internship at Teradata Aster
