# {{ page.title }}

I've been catching up with Lincoln's work. In particular I've been getting familiarized with 
openflow and  mininet. Since it's been a long time I took my networking classes, so I've been slowly 
undusting the knowledge.

Next tasks are to understand Lincoln's code for the client/server he had and the basic controller. 
I've set up mininet and now I'll run what Lincoln had in his vm. I'm doing it on my machine just to 
walkthrough the steps and understand what's going on at each.
