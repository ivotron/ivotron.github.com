title: PDF Annotations in Linux
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Today I found that a (relatively) new [effort](http://www.gnupdf.org) that will make PDF annotation 
in Linux a reality, which is really cool given the fact that we're almost in the year 2011 and, 
while all other platforms enjoy of a many alternatives for accomplishing this, we in the Linux world 
are lacking this essential functionality (at least for any person working in Academia).

In the meantime, AFAIK, the only available alternatives are:

1. [PDF-XChange through Wine][x]
2. [Mendeley][m] and its (sort-of useless) PDF annotation.

Mendeley devs [say][s] they will fix exported PDF annotations for version 1.0 of their software. Until 
then, PDF-XChange is the only functional alternative for PDF annotation in Linux.

**Update 09/20/2011**: I've found out what I've been looking for ages, the ultimate [PDF application][ezpdf]. The only 
problem: it's only available for Android. However, I've also found out this gem: [SuperPad 2 / FlyTouch 3][sp]. I'm getting 
one as soon as I have the money.
